      "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals, making decisions and taking actions with minimal human intervention. Key characteristics include:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Core Features\n",
      "- **Autonomy**: Operates independently within defined parameters\n",
      "- **Goal-oriented**: Works toward specific objectives or outcomes\n",
      "- **Decision-making**: Evaluates options and chooses actions\n",
      "- **Adaptability**: Adjusts behavior based on changing conditions\n",
      "- **Planning**: Develops multi-step strategies to achieve goals\n",
      "\n",
      "## How It Works\n",
      "Agentic AI systems typically:\n",
      "- Perceive their environment through sensors or data inputs\n",
      "- Process information to understand current situations\n",
      "- Plan sequences of actions to reach desired outcomes\n",
      "- Execute those actions\n",
      "- Learn from results to improve future performance\n",
      "\n",
      "## Current Examples\n",
      "- **Virtual assistants** that can complete complex multi-step tasks\n",
      "- **Autonomous vehicles** navigating traffic\n",
      "- **Trading algorithms** making investment decisions\n",
      "- **Game-playing AI** like chess or Go programs\n",
      "- **Robotic systems** performing warehouse operations\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Advantages:**\n",
      "- Clean, elegant code for naturally recursive problems\n",
      "- Easier to understand for certain algorithms\n",
      "- Mirrors mathematical definitions\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disadvantages:**\n",
      "- Can be memory-intensive (call stack overhead)\n",
      "- Risk of stack overflow with deep recursion\n",
      "- Sometimes slower than iterative solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "## Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "- Always define a clear base case\n",
      "- Ensure the recursive calls move toward the base case\n",
      "- Consider iterative alternatives for performance-critical code\n",
      "- Use memoization for overlapping subproblems\n",
      "\n",
      "Recursion is powerful when the problem naturally breaks down into similar smaller problems, making complex algorithms more intuitive to implement and understand.\n",
