      "- **Autonomy**: Operates independently within defined parameters\n",
      "- **Goal-oriented**: Works toward specific objectives or outcomes\n",
      "- **Decision-making**: Evaluates options and chooses actions\n",
      "- **Adaptability**: Adjusts behavior based on changing conditions\n",

      "- Perceive their environment through sensors or data inputs\n",

      "# Recursion in Programming\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Components\n",
      "\n",
      "Every recursive function needs two essential parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Base Case**: A condition that stops the recursion (prevents infinite loops)\n",
      "2. **Recursive Case**: The function calling itself with modified parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "## Simple Example\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a classic example calculating factorial:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def factorial(n):\n",
      "    # Base case\n",
      "    if n <= 1:\n",
      "        return 1\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Recursive case\n",
      "    return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "# factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## How It Works\n",
      "\n",
      "When `factorial(5)` is called:\n",
      "1. `factorial(5)` → `5 * factorial(4)`\n",
      "2. `factorial(4)` → `4 * factorial(3)`\n",
      "3. `factorial(3)` → `3 * factorial(2)`\n",
      "4. `factorial(2)` → `2 * factorial(1)`\n",
      "5. `factorial(1)` → `1` (base case reached)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the results \"bubble back up\":\n",
      "- `factorial(2)` = `2 * 1 = 2`\n",
      "- `factorial(3)` = `3 * 2 = 6`\n",
      "- `factorial(4)` = `4 * 6 = 24`\n",
      "- `factorial(5)` = `5 * 24 = 120`\n",
      "\n",
      "## Common Use Cases\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Tree traversal** (file systems, DOM manipulation)\n",
      "- **Mathematical sequences** (Fibonacci, factorial)\n",
      "- **Divide-and-conquer algorithms** (merge sort, quicksort)\n",
      "- **Parsing nested structures** (JSON, XML)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pros and Cons\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advantages:**\n",
      "- Clean, elegant code for naturally recursive problems\n",
      "- Easier to understand for certain algorithms\n",
      "- Mirrors mathematical definitions\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disadvantages:**\n",
      "- Can be memory-intensive (call stack overhead)\n",
      "- Risk of stack overflow with deep recursion\n",
      "- Sometimes slower than iterative solutions\n",
      "\n",
      "## Best Practices\n",
